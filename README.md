# Latex templates and styles for ENGR 3080

The examples here conform the the ENGR 3080 Style Guide.

If there are any inconsistancies in style or places where it doesn't conform to the style guide please send me a pull request.

## Dependencies

Minimally you will need latex, bibliotex, and biber.

To use the Makefile provide you will also need latexmk.

For Ubuntu and Debian based systems, these packages are available.
```bash
sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-bibtex-extra biber
#for the build script
sudo apt-get install make latexmk
```

For Windows or MAC you are on your own. Make a pull request and update the instructions for your particular system.

An easy way to use these files would be to import the project into [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com) or [OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

## TODO

- split out sections into different files
- make a separate .sty file
